# Interpreter-Codes

codes are about basic interpreter / compiler. i read ruslan spivak blog and he wrote articles about writing interpreter / compiler. 

That codes wrote in python. i'll convert that codes to c codes.   

# Calc1.c - Addition  
understanding on token, lexical analysis. 

A token is an object that has a type and a value.
For example, for the string “3” the type of the token will be INTEGER and the corresponding value will be integer 3.

The process of breaking the input string into tokens is called lexical analysis.

Valid expressions for Calc1 : ( simple addition operation interpreter )

we'll develop this code later. in this way this interpreter only can  add up digits not numbers.
